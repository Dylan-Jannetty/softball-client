Softball

Description:
This full-stack application is for softball leagues to organize each team by rank. When you come to the app you have the ability to see the standings of each team in your league and the players on each team. When you sign in or sign up it gives you the ability to create a team and input the record of that team then the app will automatically sort you with the rest of the teams by wins. You can then click on your team that will bring you to a page that you can create each player that has a section for number of bats and number of hits.

Planning Process & Problem-Solving Strategy:
I wanted a good plan before I started writing any code. I wrote down a list of things I wanted my APP to do by the end. I then created a set of user stories for AUTH and Client. Creating Wireframes was a bit challenging because there were multiple ways I was thinking to go about displaying my app. I stuck to the reccomended schedule that was given to us. Through all the projects I've created I found sticking to the reccomeneded schedule was a good way to meet MVP then branch out. It tends break down the project down into small groups.

Unsolved Problems:
I would like to resolve the issues I was having with deleting and updating each player by button.
In the future I plan on restyling the players page to have there rank and record at the top left and top right corner and changing where the create player lies.
